Welcome to albelli's iOS test assignment!

In this repo you'll find the starter project needed to complete the test. The assignment is as follows:

* MainViewController: use provided collection view boilerplate and photo library accessor to display the photo roll. Consider performance implications of different ways to access image data as well as scalability â€“ business may require to add more logic to photos fetch request. Reorganize the code to your taste if necessary
* ImageViewController: find a way to load selected image into the web view and handle the "Done" button click. For extra points list the ways web view can communicate with native code
* testPage.html: write a click handler for "Done" button that'll communicate the event to native code (incomplete part is marked with TODO)
* Refactor the code to use the most suitable architecture pattern given that the project will grow and will require multiple developers working on the same code. Also consider that it might be using web views for some screens
